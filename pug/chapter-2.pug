		p It all started one evening when he was reassembling an arm. He'd disassembled it to make an alteration of his own devising. The client was losing his sense of touch in his fingers. This happened over time to nearly all androids eventually, as the latex-like material they had for skin wore out in the areas with the most movement and touch: the hands. 
		p Brick's procedure was to remove all the skin of the hand at the wrist, clean the internals, and install durable sensors directly to the "bones", and leave them uncovered. It left the hands with a skeletal appearance, but more functional and easier to maintain. Now that he'd done it a dozen times, the biggest challenge was convincing the client to part with their arm overnight.
		p He was finishing his adjustments to the arm's outer casing when two androids arrived.
	.page
		h2 08 
		p The one who first spoke was a Helpmate Type B, who went by the name Castor.
		q.tagged.castor
			span Castor
			span Were you successful?
		q.tagged.brick
			span Brick
			span Well I overhauled the arm, yes.

		q.castor Is there a problem?

		p Next to him, his companion, a Type C who goes by the name Pollux, had a black cat on his shoulder. The cat crawled over to the shoulder of the Type B, and started sticking its paw in the android's empty arm socket and pawing at wires. Type B immediately picked it up with his one attached hand without looking at it, and handed it back.

		q.castor I still don't understand why you bring that creature everywhere.

		q.tagged.pollux
			span Pollux
			span She gets bored in the house. We both do.

		p Castor ignored this comment, and returned his mechanical gaze to Brick, who was watching the cat.

		q.brick.tagged
			span Brick
			span Mechanically speaking, no. Mobility should be good as new, sensory experience should be better than new. But the spasms -- you may still experience them, in the arm or elsewhere. I don't believe they're related to the mechanics of the arm. I believe it's a software problem, but I'm looking at your initial scans, and I don't see any problem with the somatic layer -- the part that governs your motor functions explicitly.

		q.tagged.pollux 
			span Pollux
			span A software problem...
		
		q.tagged.brick
			span Brick
			span If you were a human, I would say it's psychosomatic. A problem in your mind, producing physical symptoms.

		p Castor: And you don't fix software problems.
		q.tagged.brick
			span Brick
			span No one does. Sorry. 

		p Brick hesitated, unsure how to broach a delicate subject.

		p Have you ever heard the term "shivering syndrome"?
		q.castor.tagged
			span Castor
			span It's a motor function error, right? Except...

		p Here the android's silent companion jumped in with sudden interest.

		p Pollux: Those who have it are... the phrasing is "reclaimed for repair."

		q.tagged.brick
			span Brick
			span Have you been experiencing any strange thoughts?
		q.tagged.pollux
			span Pollux
			span The machinist has fixed what he can fix. Let's not trouble him further.

		p Here, Pollux cradled the cat protectively.

		p Being androids, they displayed no emotion, but they paid for the repair immediately and walked out without a further word.
	.page
		h2 09
		p It was getting late.

		p Brick went to his front door and stuck his head into the hallway. The only light out here came from the neon green sign outside his door, which depicted a symbol of the Staff of Hermes and the single word: CLINIC. The sign's green glow didn't quite reach the opposite end of the hall. He looked into the darkness there and saw nothing, heard nothing. Satisfied, he turned the sign off and closed the door.

		p Slowly, with a tired mind, Brick put away the collection of small tools he had been using to reassemble and adjust the arm. Though the clinic had some clutter here and there, his tools and parts at least all had a proper place.

		p Just as he was preparing to leave, there was a chime of the doorbell. Mildly annoyed, he half expected Castor and Pollux to return with some complaint requiring some further adjustment of the arm. But when he looked at the viewer for the camera pointed at the door, he saw something else. In the darkness, by the now unlit sign, it took him a moment to make sense of the shape: a feminine silhouette in formal dress, carrying an umbrella. 
		p He opened the door.
	.page
		h2 10
		p Before him was a woman, or something like it. Clearly an android, but with a design he was not familiar with. Instead of skin, her outer shell was made of light gray panels with obvious seams and exposed ball joints. She wore an almost victorian-style dress and skirt, complete with puffed shoulders. Her face was an unmoving mask, pure white and slightly shiny, like porcelain. The mouth had no seam, nor any part of the face. Only the eyes moved. The creature's eyes flitted about the room before resting on Brick.

		p As he was used to the same handful of customers, the prospect of a new one made him turn aside his tiredness to act professional and inviting. "Welcome. Come in," he said, and turned the interior lights back on.

		p She stepped in, which made almost no sound, and folded up her little umbrella. It was a small black umbrella with a smooth curve and sharp point. Very fashionable, Brick thought.
	.page
		h2 11
		q.tagged.sam 
			span A mechanical woman of curious design
			span You are the machinist Adrian Brick. Am I correct?

		p The voice came from the machine somewhere, but not from its mouth. Its lips were seamless and unmoving, like the rest of its mask-like face. 

		q.tagged.brick
			span Brick
			span What can I do for you? Need a repair? I'm about to close up, but would be happy to do an assessment...

		p He looked the android up and down. He wasn't familiar with the model but he'd never had a problem fixing mechanical problems in android after looking up the schematics. At a glance, he saw nothing wrong with the android. Actually, she looked pristine. Not a scratch. Either she was recently manufactured or extraordinarily well-maintained.

		q.sam No thank you. My caretaker has sent me to request your work on another matter.

		q.brick Alright. What's the issue?

		q.sam A woman named Heidi Lindbergh has gone missing.

		p Brick went to pour coffee from the pot, and then remembered that it was empty.

		q.brick I'm sorry to hear that. But what does that have to do with you and me?

		q.sam My caretaker would like you to find her.

		q.brick why me? I'm a machinist.

		q.sam Because you weren't always a machinist.

		p He processed that for a moment.

		q.brick Not that I'm entertaining this, but who's your caretaker?

		q.sam Mr. Clemen Penrose.
	.page
		h2 12

		p At this, Brick put the mug down. 

		p He'd never met the man, but almost anyone would recognize the name. Clemen Penrose was something of a hermit celebrity. He was the cofounder of THESIS Incorporated, the company responsible for the design and manufacture of all androids on Caldera. While his business partner Dr. Crane was the face of the company and the apparent visionary, Penrose was an artist who kept to himself. Brick wasn't clear exactly what his role was at the company except that he probably had something to do with the androids' unusual aesthetic design. While Brick might define a celebrity as someone known for being known, Clemen Penrose was sort of known for being unknown. A public curiosity. 
		p At any rate, Brick was surprised that he was still in Caldera. Then again, maybe Clemen had already left, and just left his android here just like everyone else.
	.page
		h2 13

		q.brick And who is Heidi to Clemen? Girlfriend?

		q.sam I have assumed so.

		q.brick You don't know?

		q.sam He doesn't like to talk of himself. But he is prepared to pay you 3000 credits.

		q.brick Not that I'm entertaining it, but what if I don't find her?

		q.sam That would be fine. This is who you're looking for.

		p As she said this, Brick his phone chimed. An email notification. The subject was simply "Heidi Lindbergh"  and had a file attachment. Not wanting to imply his acceptance, he didn't open it.

		q.sam 3000 credits for a thorough investigation over the next two weeks, regardless of your exact findings. 

		p After a moment's thought, he folded his arms. "No." I've got a few things to wrap up in Caldera, and then I'm out of here. I don't want to get distracted.

		p That's right. He had only to keep his head down for another three weeks, and he would be done with this godforsaken place. "Sorry, but tell your caretaker I'm not taking on any special jobs right now."

		q.sam There is no need to make a decision today. Please think on it, and I'll return tomorrow for your answer.

		q.brick But I just answered you.

		q.sam I understand. I must tell you that, should you decline, my caretaker is happy to tell the city exactly how much you've done for the android community. 

		p Brick froze.

		q.brick what exactly do you mean by that?

		p The android tilted its head.

		q.sam He said you'd know what it means. He also said it's best to have both a carrot and a stick. 

		p She simply looked, with that opaque look of hers.

		q.brick You can go now.
		p He waved his hand as if batting away a pest.

		p After having barely moved during the conversation, she bowed deeply while holding the hem of her dress. Almost a curtsy, a gesture he had not seen outside of period-piece television. Then she turned and left without further comment.
	.page 
		h2 14
		p After she left, he had several lines of thought.

		h3 Blackmail

		p On the one hand, he ought to refuse the case on principle alone. At least, that's what someone else would say. But Brick wasn't typically swayed by the idea of doing something, or not doing it, for the sake of some abstract principle. He knew he should be angry, but as usual with such situations, he found himself unable to summon any kind of emotional outburst. Either the offer was compelling or it wasn't. He hadn't yet decided which. But 3000 credits was a lot of money.

		h3 Clemen Penrose

		p Clemen Penrose. According to his public profile, he was a "Senior Designer" at THESIS Incorporated. It wasn't clear what this title entailed. Possibly just the aesthetic direction of the androids. Whatever his role once was, THESIS was now a bankrupt company with no CEO, no headquarters and no employees. Hard to believe there was anything to be designed at this point. 

		p It seemed Clemen had stayed completely out of the news and limelight since THESIS went under. He owned a large estate on the uppermost floor of Caldera. Brick wasn't sure Clemen had ever actually been seen outside his home in recent history. Brick wasn't even sure the man actually lived there, and hadn't returned to earth already. 

		p His life before THESIS wasn't a secret though. He was an artist most famous for his handmade marionettes. He had something of a cult following.

		h3 Samantha

		p Samantha. Clemen probably at least had a hand in designing her appearance. Her looks followed THESIS' design language. Which is to say she looked more like a porcelain doll or a marionette than a human. But, it was more than that. Brick had always assumed that the mechanical, non-realistic look of androids was a cost-saving measure, or because THESIS wasn't yet capable of manufacturing something more lifelike. He assumed that the company's ultimate vision would be to make androids that looked and felt like humans. One look at Samantha called that assumption into question. 

		p In many ways she resembled THESIS' earliest creations, which had unmoving faces and exposed mechanical joints, before their manufacturing became more precise. But this one exhibited these qualities to a more extreme degree, but in a refined way—what struck him as a purer way. There was no compromise, no attempt to be mistaken for a human, no attempt to make humans comfortable. 

		p Indeed, he hadn't noticed it until she left, but looking at this "Samantha" android made him uncomfortable, even though he had grown used to talking to androids in general.
	.page
		h2 15
		h3 Heidi

		p The email Samantha sent him contained only an attached image and the text:

		q.screen Heidi Lindbergh HZR-G89WZDQ9345

		p He opened the image, which struck him right away. She had what looked to be a massive burn on the left side of her face. Almost like the skin had melted. It drooped slightly. Knowing nothing of medicine, its cause was something he was not qualified to determine, but it reminded him of old photos he'd seen in historical news stories about women deliberately disfigured with acid.

		p Heidi Lindbergh was a name he hadn't heard before — not that he expected to have heard it, but the population of Caldera these days was small enough that the chance of having met any particular person was not negligible.  Accessing the semi-public directory of citizens on Caldera, there was indeed a Heidi Lindbergh. Her last known address was the same as Penrose.

		p According to public record, her address was the same as Penrose. Her occupation was listed as "photographer." Other than that, there was no other information. In fact she seemed to have no internet presence at all, at least not under her name.

		p He looked at the photo again. Putting aside the scarring, which shocked him a little less on the second look, she had a beautiful face. To confirm this, Brick put his hand over the burned side and imagined a mirror of the other side. 

		p Though he didn't admit it to himself right then, the photo intrigued him on its own. Still, he had little intention of being involved in any of this if he could help it. The shuttle arrived in three weeks.
	.page
		h2 16
		p It'd been a long few months, eating mostly redroot in its endless forms, but with the payment from the twins for the arm repair, Brick managed to save just enough for a seat on the shuttle.

		p At least, that's what he thought until he went to buy one online. The price had nearly doubled. He blinked, then refreshed the page, hoping in vain that it was an error.

		q.screen One ticket to New Alexandria, United Republic of Earth, from Caldera, Mars. 5000 credits (make a graphic of this)

		p Determined to keep calm, he called the shuttle agency. After moment on hold, which gave him a minute to calm himself, he hung up the phone before anyone answered. There was no purpose in demanding an explanation for the price hike. The reason was obvious. Last time, only the most cautious, forward-thinking people wanted a ride home. Now, everyone did. Demand exploded, and shuttles couldn't be built overnight. And they took months to travel, depending on the time of year.

		p Of the people still here, many had lots of money and not much to buy with it. Less all the time, in fact. He simply wasn't going to be able to afford it this time. As simple as that. Maybe he could catch the next one. In 6 months.

		p Six months of redroot and Chinese takeout. Six months of no coffee. Six months of hoping the heat continues to work. 6 Months hoping the androids didn't find out too much about him.

		p Even then, it wasn't just that people were in a rush. He knew the real reason for the price hike is that the next ride wasn't a guarantee.  There were no guarantees anymore.
	.page
		h2 17
		p After pacing around his apartment for a frustrated moment, he returned the computer. A quick search revealed that Clemen's address was a large residential property on an upper level. That wasn't surprising. What seemed odd was the idea that Clemen actually still lived there.

		p After his cofounder was arrested and the future of the city was called into question, he figured all the people rich enough to leave had already left. If he was really still here, he wanted to see for himself.

		p He grabbed his coat and left. Clemen's robot said she would return tomorrow, but he didn't like that. It was worth setting the tone that not everything was going to be on Clemen's terms. Besides, he always made it a point to investigate the client before investigating whatever the client wanted.

		p After a long walk during which he saw no one, he arrived at area 9B, a luxury floor. As such, the hallway was wider and the doors further apart, but other than that looked the same as any other residential floor from the outside. Looking at the numbers on each door, Brick found that Clemen's was at the very end. The hallway dead-ended into a wall with a single door, illuminated by two orb-shaped lights, one on either side. Though it wasn't any larger than the other doors, it was more ornate. It had a subtle geometric pattern, polished brass-colored trim, and a doorknob in the form of a curled, elongated level. Combined with it being at the end of the hall, there was something stately about it, as if the whole hallway were designed to draw attention to this one door.
	
	.page
		h2 18

		p Brick rang the doorbell, then waited. Nothing happened. Given the hour, Clemen might be asleep. He rang again. The doorbell made no sound to the outside, planting a doubt as to whether it worked (such doubts were the norm in Caldera). He was about to knock when he heard a voice.

		q.sam.tagged
			span A feminine voice
			span How can I help you?
		
		p Muffled through the door, he wasn't sure who it belonged to. Possibly the robot.

		q.brick.tagged
			span Brick
			span It's Brick.

		p The door opened a crack, showing a woman's silhouette backlit by interior lights. It was Samantha. For just a moment he thought it was a human; he had to squint to see the mechanical arms and doll-like face which had been so obvious in better lighting.

		q.brick I need to talk to your Caretaker.

		q.sam Mr. Penrose has retired for the evening.

		q.brick If he wants me to take the job, he'll get out of bed.

		p She stood immobile for a moment without reply, then opened the door.

		q.sam I'll retrieve him. 

		p She walked in and left the door ajar, which he took as his invitation. 

		p He was in an expansive open room, which was wrapped in a staircase that spiraled upward along the walls in a square. The estate had a small footprint, but looked to be three or four stories high, and gave a cavernous impression.

		p Samantha ascended the stairs without in perfect rhythm expected from a machine, then disappeared into some nook above.
	.page
		h2 19

		p The place had a checkered black and white tile floor. In the corner was a cozy spot with a plush chair — a rarity in Caldera — and a rug and a side table. Other than this, there was no furniture in the big square room. Instead, there were numerous white square pedestals, each with some curiosity atop it.

		p With nothing better to do for the moment, Brick examined the strangest looking one. At a glance, it looked to be some mechanical device, but up close it was clearly art for art's sake. A figure made of iron, a feminine shape with a flower atop its head and an octopus-like lower half.  The limbs had movable joints, like an artist's reference doll.

		p The pedestal next to it had a white sculpture of a man's head. One was a geometric iron sculpture which took on a surprisingly different silhoutte from different viewpoints. Combined with the lack of furniture, it felt like a museum. In this context, Samantha's odd design matched the decor.

		p Above was a great iron chandalier with many protruding lights, looming like a spider.

		p The mind of such an exceedingly rich person seemed alien to Brick. This was the home of an eccentric, without a doubt. But it also fit with his theory that rich people had large homes to house their collection of vanity objects.

		p At last, Samantha came back down the stairs, followed by a small man. He wore a black turtleneck and large, round glasses. His blonde hair was so light in color that it almost looked white, making him seem like an old man at a glance, though he was probably no older than 40.
	.page
		h2 20
		p The man turned to the android.
		q.clemen.tagged
			span Clemen
			span This is Adrean, I presume?

		p She nodded. Clemen cleared his throat.

		q.clemen I, uh, I take it you've accepted my offer, then. He rubbed his eyes.

		q.brick.tagged
			span Brick
			span Not exactly. I want more details.

		q.clemen Oh, um. (here he paused awkwardly for a long moment) Yes of course. 

		p Brick glanced at Samantha, who was looking looking alternately at Brick and Clemen, moving only her eyes. 

		q.brick let's talk privately.

		p Clemen ushered Brick through a doorway, which led to a kitchen. Samantha took a step to follow, but Clemen held his hand up.
		q.clemen It's alright.
		p She withdrew. Penrose was a small man, and he wondered if he used Samantha as a bodyguard of sorts. Brick naturally towered over him.

		q.brick Just what exactly do you know about me?

		q.clemen I know what happened to my esteemed colleague and friend, Dr. Crane. I know how and why it happened, and that he was arrested by, uh... (here he glanced in Samantha's direction, then lowered his voice) by a certain Urespa agent. Your android friends don't know. For the time being, there is no reason to tell them.

		p he sniffled, tilted his head up and held his nose with his eyes closed for a moment, suppressing a sneeze.

		p Sorry. Uh, anyway, I don't want you to work for free of course. Samantha told you, right? 3000 credits. I can pay half now, half in two weeks.
	
	.page
		h2 21

		p Well played, thought Brick. It seemed to Brick that the problem with blackmail is, the person being blackmailed has no real assurance that the blackmailer won't use the same information later. They must either rebel, or expect to be the blackmailer's puppet indefinitely. But in this case, in three weeks Brick would be off this rock, and the information wouldn't matter anymore. He really had only to go along with this job. And by paying him half up front, it gave the whole arrangement an air of good faith, of a legitimate business transaction between equals. Suppressing his urge to rebel. He still felt manipulated, yet, he had no good reason to reject the offer... except one.

	.page
		h2 22

		p One condition, said Brick.

		q.clemen Alright.

		q.brick Let's say I don't find her. Or I find her dead. 

		q.clemen I will of course pay the full amount for two weeks of diligent investigation, regardless of the results. 
		p In contrast to his usually stumbling speech, it seemed that he had rehearsed this part. But that wasn't the condition Brick was most concerned about.

		q.brick Fine. But let's say I find Heidi, she's alive and well, and she doesn't want to see you. I'm not going to tell you where she is.

		p Clemen looked away, suddenly very interested in a painting on his own wall. He responded very quietly. "Yes, of course."

		p Brick hesitated, almost regretting Clemen's agreement, but then offered his hand. "Very well, then"

		p Clemen went to shake it, but then withdrew his hand, seemingly having suddenly forgot something.

		q.clemen Oh, yes! I do have one condition too. Samantha will accompany you for the investigation.

		q.brick What?

		p Clemen waved a hand in reassurance.

		q.clemen I'm sorry, I know it's an inconvenience. But see that is how I'll have some assurance that you did all you could to find Heidi, even if you're unsuccessful.

		q.brick But if your android knows where Heidi is, then you could have her tell you.

		q.clemen No, no, not at all. And she can accompany you however you are comfortable. She doesn't have to follow the details of the investigation or accompany you at every moment. But if she stays with you, I'll have some assurance that you were indeed working on the case. That's all.

		p Brick thought of protesting, but had no specific argument just now, and was not the sort to become angry until he had one.
	
	.page
		h2 23
		p In the silence, Clemen coughed again.

		q.clemen To tell you the truth, there's another reason I want Samantha to accompany you. She, uh, doesn't get out much. She hasn't seen much of Caldera. She likes to ask questions, like a child, you see. I suppose in a way, she is. I want her to see a bit more of the world. I feel selfish keeping her here with me all the time. She's old enough to be curious about the city. I'd feel better if someone went with her. All the better if it's someone who knows how androids work, should anything happen. I'm just an old man who feels protective, that's all. I'd show her around myself, but it's, uh, it's hard for me to get out these days.

	
	.page
		h2 24

		p Though Brick was listening, his mind was fixated on some adjacent point.

		q.brick Tell me something.

		q.clemen Hmm?

		q.brick Is Samantha a tribute, or a replacement?

		q.clemen Pardon?

		p Brick pulled up the photograph of Heidi on his phone. 
		q.brick I noticed it when I first saw this, but I had to see Samantha in person again to be sure. They're the same. Even though Samantha is ... not very realistic, let's say ... she has Heidi's features, not withstanding the burn. The color of the eyes, the cheekbones, the lips, the chin, the hair. Even the narrow shoulders. Not the skin of course, but the shape is clearly the same. Almost like you made a mask from a cast of Heidi's face. So I'll ask again. Tribute, or replacement?

		p Clemen nodded slowly, with a slight almost wistful smile, looking at the ground. Like a shy child being praised. He took off his glasses, and started cleaning one of the lenses with his shirt. 

		q.clemen Samantha is... simply my best work, that's all. Truly inspired. Samantha and Heidi would have gotten along, I'm sure.

		p He paused for a long while, thinking, then put his glasses back on.

		q.clemen I'm sure it seems strange. You are welcome to think my design choices odd. But, appearances aside, Samantha is an independent mind. Please think of her as such.

		p Brick sighed.
		q.brick  Fine. But if she gets in the way, I'm returning to sender.

		q.clemen Perfect.
		p Here Clemen extended his hand. Brick shook it
		q.clemen I'll transfer your initial payment today.
	
	.page
		h2 25

		q.brick One more thing. What's with the umbrella?

		q.clemen Hmm. 
		p He put a finger to his lips thoughtfully, but said nothing more.

		q.brick When your android showed up. She had an umbrella. 

		p Brick was vaguely aware of some mention of umbrellas in some android's documentation, but couldn't remember where. It was in fact on page 30 of the original Helpmate's manual.

		q.screen
			p While the Helpmate(TM) is water resistant, it is not waterproof. They contain steel parts which will rust if neglected, and some connections may short if too wet, which could cause permanent damage. To ensure a long, healthy service life for your Helpmate, please observe the following guidelines.

			p Never submerge the Helpmate in water or send it out in heavy rain. Light rain shouldn’t cause problems, but we do suggest an umbrella. A patented THESIS umbrella can be found at your local android supply store or through one of our online partners.

			p If the Helpmate gets significantly wet, turn it off immediately. Dry it with a towel, and then allow it to air dry completely before turning it on again. THESIS is not responsibly for any damage resulting from leaving the Helpmate on when it is wet.

			p If you have a Helpmate II or Helpmate Porcelain Collection, oil its exposed joints regularly to avoid rust. If light rust has begun, we suggest cleaning it with a scrubbing sponge dipped in alcohol. If the rust is severe, take your Helpmate to a THESIS certified technician.

			p While we know you’ll do your best to care for your Helpmate, we know accidents can happen. If you would like to purchase an extended care plan to insure against water damage and other mishaps, simply contact a THESIS representative before your warranty expires.

		p Of course, rain was not possible in Caldera. While the rest of the android's dress seemed fashionable, the umbrella put it over the top, making the whole thing look like a costume.

		q.clemen That is a puzzle, isn't it? 
		p He chuckled to himself quietly.
		q.clemen I'm really not sure. She wanted one after seeing it in an advertisement.
