      <h2>01</h2>
      <p>Two months ago, there was a knock at the door of the clinic. Brick peeked through the hole to see three people: a big Russian guy. A tall, skinny woman who was obviously trying to suppress a smile. And a serious looking guy with a military haircut. Brick opened the door. It was the serious looking guy who spoke.</p>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside</span><span>According to official records... it's your birthday.</span></q>
      <p>They looked about the room as they entered.</p>
      <q class="tagged mitya"><span>Mitya</span><span>Nice place.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"><span>Burnside</span><span>You get much business?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged brick"><span>Brick </span><span>Not at first, but it's picking up. My customers are... a bit slow to trust humans.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"><span>Burnside</span><span>Smart of them, isn't it.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged brick"><span>Brick</span><span>Maybe.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"><span>Burnside</span><span>Anyway, look what I found.</span></q>
      <p>He held up a tall glass bottle.</p>
      <q class="tagged brick"><span>Brick</span><span>That's not some hooch you made in your basement, is it?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"><span>Burnside</span><span>No, no, no. The real deal. Some fool must have imported it, and then left without it.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Imagine paying for shipping out here, and then not drinking it.</span></q>
      <p>Brick examined the bottle. Already opened, with approximately two, no, three shots missing. </p>
      <q class="tagged brick"><span>Brick</span><span>Already been in it, I see.</span></q>
      <q>Mitya smiled innocently. </q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Had to make sure the goods were up to our standard.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged brick"> <span>Brick</span><span>Brick uh huh.</span></q>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h2>02</h2>
      <p>Brick got some glasses from a cupboard, and poured them all a drink. He took a sip himself, and closed his eyes to appreciate it.</p>
      <q class="tagged brick">Brick So what have you lot been up to?</q>
      <p>They looked at each other, a hint of awkwardness hung in the air.</p>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Sorry, can't share that with civilians.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged lottie"><span>Lottie</span><span>Don't say it like *that*.</span></q>
      <p>Brick simply nodded. Burnside shrugged.</p>
      <q class="tagged burnside"><span>Burnside</span><span>Same as always. Making sure the human race doesn't go extinct or anything.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged brick"> <span>Brick </span><span>Yeah? How's that looking?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"><span>Burnside</span><span>Better, since you took out our main problem. Nice shot by the way, like, damn.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Yeah, about that. We've been trying to settle something. who's the best shot in Caldera. You or Lottie.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged lottie"><span>Lottie</span><span>what are you, twelve?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Mitya come on. like, who would win in a gun fight?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside, rolling his eyes</span><span>Those aren't even the same question</span></q>
      <q class="brick tagged"><span>Brick</span><span>Hmm. it depends whether Lottie *knows* we're going to have a gunfight.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Such a *you* answer.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside</span><span>I can tell you we're looking into something. If you run into any skinless androids, steer cleer.</span></q>
      <q class="brick tagged"> <span>Brick</span><span>Skinless?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside</span><span>There's word some androids are removing all their skin as a sign of separation with humanity. Or some such nonsense. They resent the fact that they look human. It's time to move beyond all that, they say.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Of course, if they want to rock the Terminator look, we ain't the fashion police.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside</span><span>True. but it's just the kind of rhetoric we've been worried about. So we'll see where it goes. that's all.</span></q>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h2>03</h2>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside</span><span>Have you seen they made a little shrine? the androids, I mean.</span></q>
      <p>Brick was just starting to smile, but at this his expression fell.</p>
      <q class="tagged brick"> <span>Brick </span><span>... yeah. Yeah, I've seen it.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Weird. It's like, the mind of an android isn't something we were meant to understand, you know?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged lottie"> <span>Lottie</span><span>I don't know, I don't think it's that hard to understand. It's like a memorial for a parent, right?</span></q>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h2>04</h2>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside</span><span>I heard you're leaving. </span></q>
      <p>He looked at his empty glass, but didn't pour another.</p>
      <q class="burnside tagged"><span>Burnside</span><span>I was gonna ask if you were ready to join up with us again, but I guess that answers my question. If you wanted your job back, you could have it in a heartbeat. Not that I care, but Lottie missies you.</span></q>
      <q class="lottie tagged"> <span>Lottie </span><span>Well, I didn't say *that.*</span></q>
      <q class="burnside tagged"> <span>Burnside</span><span>I didn't say you said it.</span></q>
      <q class="burnside tagged"><span>Burnside</span><span>You know, I want to go home too, but we came for a reason. On that note. we should get back to work. </span></q>
      <p>He stood up. Lottie followed suit. Mitya finished his drink first. They headed toward the door.</p>
      <q class="burnside tagged"> <span>Burnside</span><span>I know you want to be some kind of neutral party here, but there's no such thing. This is too important.</span></q>
      <p>Lottie lingered, looking around the room.</p>
      <q class="lottie tagged"><span>Lottie</span><span>This little clinic really is a nice place. I'm glad you... I'm glad you found a place.</span></q>
      <p>In a moment, they were gone. He looked at the bottle. He felt heavy. It was a nice parting gift.</p>
