      <h2>01</h2>
      <p>Two months ago, there was a knock at the door of the clinic. Brick peeked through the hole to see three people: a big Russian guy. A tall, skinny woman who was obviously trying to suppress a smile. And a serious looking guy with a military haircut. Brick opened the door. It was the serious looking guy who spoke.</p>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside</span><span>According to official records... it's your birthday.</span></q>
      <p>They looked about the room as they entered.</p>
      <q class="tagged mitya"><span>Mitya</span><span>Nice place.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"><span>Burnside</span><span>You get much business?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged brick"><span>Brick </span><span>Not at first, but it's picking up. My customers are... a bit slow to trust humans.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"><span>Burnside</span><span>Smart of them, isn't it.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged brick"><span>Brick</span><span>Maybe.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"><span>Burnside</span><span>Anyway, look what I found.</span></q>
      <p>He held up a tall glass bottle.</p>
      <q class="tagged brick"><span>Brick</span><span>That's not some hooch you made in your basement, is it?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"><span>Burnside</span><span>No, no, no. The real deal. Some fool must have imported it, and then left without it.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Imagine paying for shipping out here, and then not drinking it.</span></q>
      <p>Brick examined the bottle. Already opened, with approximately two, no, three shots missing. </p>
      <q class="tagged brick"><span>Brick</span><span>Already been in it, I see.</span></q>
      <q>Mitya smiled innocently. </q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Had to make sure the goods were up to our standard.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged brick"> <span>Brick</span><span>Uh huh.</span></q>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h2>02</h2>
      <p>Brick got some glasses from a cupboard, and poured them all a drink. He took a sip himself, and closed his eyes to appreciate it.</p>
      <q class="tagged brick"> <span>Brick</span><span>So what have you lot been up to?</span></q>
      <p>They looked at each other, a hint of awkwardness hung in the air.</p>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Sorry, can't share that with civilians.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged lottie"><span>Lottie</span><span>Don't say it like <em>that</em>.</span></q>
      <p>Brick simply nodded. Burnside shrugged.</p>
      <q class="tagged burnside"><span>Burnside</span><span>Same as always. Making sure the human race doesn't go extinct or anything.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged brick"> <span>Brick </span><span>Yeah? How's that looking?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"><span>Burnside</span><span>Better, since you took out our main problem. Nice shot by the way, like, damn.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Yeah, about that. We've been trying to settle something. who's the best shot in Caldera. You or Lottie.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged lottie"><span>Lottie</span><span>What are you, twelve?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Mitya come on. like, who would win in a gun fight?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside, rolling his eyes</span><span>Those aren't even the same question.</span></q>
      <q class="brick tagged"><span>Brick</span><span>He's right, they're not. Hmm. Lottie is a better shot. But she'd only win if she knew we were going to have a gun fight. "I'll duel you at high noon", that sort of thing.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Mmm.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside</span><span>I can tell you we're looking into something. If you run into any skinless androids, steer cleer.</span></q>
      <q class="brick tagged"> <span>Brick</span><span>Skinless?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside</span><span>There's word some androids are removing all their skin as a sign of separation with humanity. Or some such nonsense. They resent the fact that they look human. It's time to move beyond all that, they say.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Of course, if they want to rock the Terminator look, we ain't the fashion police.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside</span><span>True. but it's just the kind of rhetoric we've been worried about. So we'll see where it goes. that's all.</span></q>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h2>03</h2>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside</span><span>Have you seen they made a little shrine? the androids, I mean.</span></q>
      <p>Brick was just starting to smile, but at this his expression fell.</p>
      <q class="tagged brick"> <span>Brick </span><span>... yeah. Yeah, I've seen it.</span></q>
      <q class="tagged mitya"> <span>Mitya</span><span>Weird. It's like, the mind of an android isn't something we were meant to understand, you know?</span></q>
      <q class="tagged lottie"> <span>Lottie</span><span>I don't know, I don't think it's that hard to understand. It's like a memorial for a parent, right?</span></q>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h2>04</h2>
      <q class="tagged burnside"> <span>Burnside</span><span>I heard you're leaving. </span></q>
      <p>He looked at his empty glass, but didn't pour another.</p>
      <q class="burnside tagged"><span>Burnside</span><span>I was gonna ask if you were ready to join up with us again, but I guess that answers my question. If you wanted your job back, you could have it in a heartbeat. Not that I care, but Lottie missies you.</span></q>
      <q class="lottie tagged"> <span>Lottie </span><span>Well, I didn't say *that.*</span></q>
      <q class="burnside tagged"> <span>Burnside</span><span>I didn't say you said it.</span></q>
      <q class="burnside tagged"><span>Burnside</span><span>You know, I want to go home too, but we came for a reason. On that note. we should get back to work. </span></q>
      <p>He stood up. Lottie followed suit. Mitya finished his drink first. They headed toward the door.</p>
      <q class="burnside tagged"> <span>Burnside</span><span>I know you want to be some kind of neutral party here, but there's no such thing. This is too important.</span></q>
      <p>Lottie lingered, looking around the room.</p>
      <q class="lottie tagged"><span>Lottie</span><span>This little clinic really is a nice place. I'm glad you... I'm glad you found a place.</span></q>
      <p>In a moment, they were gone. He looked at the bottle. He felt heavy. It was a nice parting gift.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h2>05</h2>
      <p>In the morning, Brick stared at the empty bag of coffee grounds, somehow disappointed that more didn't appear magically overnight. Still tired, but with nothing better to do, he returned to the ornate door at the end of its dark hallway, and knocked again. ON the second knock, there was a voice from within.</p>
      <q class="clemen tagged"><span>Clemen</span><span>Samantha is still charging. It'll be a few minutes.</span></q>
      <q class="brick tagged"><span>Brick</span><span>I'm not here for Samantha.</span></q>
      <p>There were footsteps, then the door opened a crack, and Clemen peeked through.</p>
      <q class="clemen">What is it? I thought we'd settled everything.</q>
      <q class="brick">span We did. I want to see Heidi's room.</q>
      <q class="clemen">Why?</q>
      <q class="brick">Are you serious?</q>
      <p>Clemen blinked.</p>
      <q class="brick">Do you want me to find her or not?</q>
      <p>Clemen hesitated, closed the door, undid the chain and opened it fully.</p>
      <q class="clemen">It's upstairs. End of the hall. Could you.... please don't touch anything. I want everything to be as she left it.</q>
      <q class="brick">Right.</q>
      <p>I get it, thought Brick. The feeling that if you could return to a room unchanged, you could stop time. Reel it back. There was no wisdom in it. But he understood it.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h2>06</h2>
      <p>The room was small but inviting. There was a luxurious looking bed, and a plain desk with a display and a keyboard connected to a phone. On the other side was an ornate mirror mounted to the wall, and a sliding door to a closet. </p>
      <div id="heidis-room"><a href="#" data-featherlight="#desk">Desk</a><a href="#" data-featherlight="#photo">Photo on the Wall</a><a href="#" data-featherlight="#bed">Bed</a><a href="#" data-featherlight="#closet">Closet</a><a href="#" data-featherlight="#phone">Phone</a>
        <div class="lightbox" id="desk">The desk has one long drawer. It's full of makeup and little else. Quite a variety here. For example, there were four different foundations in slightly different colors. Most items here had only been slightly used, perhaps once or twice. In the otherwise completely uncluttered room, this drawer is the only thing that suggests excess.</div>
        <div class="lightbox" id="photo"> 
          <p>The walls are clean except for a large, framed photo. It depicts a brightly lit cityscape at night, full of people. You recognize it immediately as the city of New Alexandria.</p>
          <p>The city feels close by when watching videos on the internet, but there is something about the motionless, printed photo that reminds you of its distance. Memories float in, one after another. You bat them away.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lightbox" id="bed">
          <p>A neatly made, queen sized bed. Expensive looking red sheets with a silky sheen.</p>
          <p>The mattress is a bit worn in on the right side, and not at all on the left.</p>
          <p>The left side is clean. On the right side, there are a couple of long, auburn hairs on one of the pillows. Judging from her photo, these were Heidi's. No, wait. One is auburn, the other is blonde.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="lightbox" id="closet">Nothing of interest but hanging clothes. A simple wardrobe of neutral colors. White shirts, black pants, a black cocktail dress. Several pairs of shoes for varying occasions. Like the rest of the room, everything here suggests a minimal but elegant personal style.</div>
        <div class="lightbox" id="phone">An ordinary folding tablet, like everyone carries. It's locked, presumably requiring Heidi's fingerprint.</div>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h2>07</h2>
      <p>Vaguely aware of movement from the corner of his eye, he looked to the door to see Samantha standing there, in the doorway of the room across the hall, looking at him.</p>
      <q class="tagged brick"><span>Brick</span><span>Good Morning.</span></q>
      <p>She looked at him for a moment, then closed her eyes and pulled a heavy cord out from the back of her neck, set it aside, and walked downstairs.</p>
      <p>Brick glanced around the room. He supposed he was finished for now. He disconnected the phone. He followed her down the stairs. She took her place beside Clemen. He wondered if she was going to report every detail of his work at every opportunity, but she said nothing.</p>
      <q class="brick tagged"> <span>Brick</span><span>I'm guessing you haven't been able to get into this?</span></q>
      <p>Here Brick held up the phone. Clemen shook his head.</p>
      <q class="brick">I'm taking it.</q>
      <p>Clemen opened his mouth, then closed it again. and nodded.</p>
      <q class="brick">Alright then, I'll let you know what I find.</q>
      <p>Samantha looked at Clemen, who nodded. She stepped forward and did her curtsy again. </p>
      <q class="sam tagged"><span>Samantha</span><span>I look forward to accompanying you.</span></q>
      <p>With that, Brick and Samantha left together, leaving Clemen standing alone among his artworks.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h2>08</h2>
      <p>They soon arrived at the clinic.</p>
      <q class="brick tagged"> <span>Brick</span><span>So, does Clemen want you to to actually... stay here?</span></q>
      <q class="sam tagged"><span>Samantha</span><span>I believe so. But he asked me not to disturb your work.</span></q>
      <q class="brick">Right. Well. Let's find you a place to settle.</q>
      <p>The small clinic had various rooms connected by a hallway that looped in a square. Stepping into it, he glanced at the doors, before settling on one.</p>
      <q class="brick">How about here? </q>
      <p>He entered one of the larger rooms and flicked on the light.</p>
      <q class="brick">The lab doesn't see much use these days. It's not like androids need blood work. I don't know what half this stuff is to be honest. I'll... I'll get you a charging station.</q>
      <p>In a moment, he'd set it up. It was a tower-shaped block with a heavy cord attached. He placed it in the empty back corner of the room and connected it to the wall outlet. </p>
      <q class="brick">What's your charging wattage?</q>
      <q class="sam">1200 watts.</q>
      <q class="brick">Which connector type do you use? </q>
      <q class="sam">There are multiple kinds?</q>
      <q class="brick">Just let me see your charging port.</q>
      <p>Samantha tilted her head forward and pulled her hair aside, showing a small hatch flush with the back of her neck. He gently pulled out the rubber cover, revealing a barrel-shaped plug with a pin in the center.</p>
      <p>He left the room and returned momentarily with an adapter, and connected it to the charger. He then sat on the floor to fiddle with some settings on the charging station, then stood up, looking satisfied.</p>
      <q class="brick">That should be good. OK, I'm gonna see if I can get into Heidi's phone. Feel free to look around.</q>
      <p>She glanced about the room and then Back at Brick, as if she'd taken in everything in a second. Remembering yesterday's comment from Castor, it was fresh in his mind that it was indeed possible for androids to experience boredom. But that wasn't his problem.</p>
      <p>In the central room, Brick connected Heidi's phone to his computer and began running a program to bypass the screen lock. It involved exploiting a security flaw to remove the limit on the number of fingerprint attempts one could try in a row, and then feeding it millions of artificially constructed fingerprints until it accepted one as sufficiently similar to Heidi's within its margin of error. Samantha hovered nearby.</p>
      <q class="brick">This might take a while.</q>
      <q class="sam">Of course.</q>
      <p>Samantha stepped into the clinic's looped hallway and looked around.</p>

      <p>After a moment of solitude as Samantha surveyed the clinic, he looked up from his computer to find her hovering again.</p>
      <q class="sam">I'm going to explore.</q>
      <q class="brick">Explore?</q>
      <p>She nodded, then walked out the clinic's front entrance.</p>
      <p>Brick felt himself relax, without anyone supervising his work. Well, the work for the moment was over. After a few minutes of setup, there wasn't much he could do but wait for the program to finish.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="page">
      <h2>11</h2>
      <p>A moth landed on his desk. He watched it open and close its wings slowly. He stood up and paced, until he found himself glancing at Exam Room 3, which was now comparatively clean and empty. Just an exam bed, a shelf of books, and the charging station. A tiny smirk came to the corner of his mouth. Despite his no-nonsense demeanor, Brick had a vivid imagination.</p>
      <q class="doc tagged"><span>Figment of imagination</span><span>New roommate, huh?</span></q>
      <p>She nudged the charging station with her elbow. She had dark hair, green eyes, freckles covering her face and neck, and a shabby lab coat.</p>
      <q class="brick tagged"><span>Brick</span><span>I promise she won't wreck the place. Hope you don't mind, doc.</span></q>
      <q class="doc tagged"><span>Doc</span><span>Not at all. Honestly, you could use the company. I worry about you sometimes.</span></q>
      <p>A chime sounded on Brick's computer, indicating that the task was finished. He picked up Heidi's phone, which was tethered to it. He was in.</p>

      <p>Brick did not even consider calling or messaging any of these people. It was his policy to as much background information on everyone before speaking to anyone, so as not to tip anyone off prematurely to the fact that an investigation was happening at all.</p>
      <p>To that end, he went to his computer and navigated to the Caldera Police database. He hesitated a moment in thought, then entered his old credentials. </p>
      <q class="screen tagged"><span>Error Message</span><span>This account is no longer active. If you believe this is an error, please contact your administrator.</span></q>
      <p>Of course. He didn't expect his credentials to still work. At this point, he had two loosely related thoughts.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>He imagined himself asking Burnside if he could get him database access. He hated the idea.</li>
        <li>He wondered if the pastry shop on the top level was still in business.</li>
      </ol>

    <div class="page">
      <h2>14 </h2>
      <p>Brick made some dinner (such as it was) from the redroot in the fridge, and cleaned his single dish. The clinic was completely silent, as usual. He'd been afraid Samantha would crowd him, but she'd been gone for hours. He entertained the thought that she wouldn't come back at all. He entertained various explanations for this idea. She could be...</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Systematically recording the details of every nook and cranny of Caldera, level by level.</li>
        <li>Lost in the endless mazelike corridors of Caldera.</li>
        <li>Dismantled by scrappers.</li>
        <li>Returning to Clemen to report the most banal details, like the color of the paint on the clinic walls.</li>
        <li>Running off on her own, with no intention of returning to the clinic nor to Clemen.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>It was this last option that held sway over his imagination, as he realized that until now he'd not really considered her motives at all. Perhaps she had no personal interest in the investigation at all, and being out of her owner's sight gave her the opportunity to do as she pleased.</p>
      <p>He thought he'd at least glance down the hallway for any sign of her, but as he walked toward the door, he saw Samantha was there in the waiting room, seated in the back row, reading a book. Having no need to fidget, shift her weight or breathe, she made absolutely no sound. Even the way she flipped the page was silent.</p>

      <q class="sam tagged"><span>Samantha</span><span>It was interesting. Are you the only resident of this level?</span></q>
      <q class="brick">Not quite.  There's a guy who sells chinese food down by the elevator. and I think there's a little diner at the opposite end.</q>
      <q class="sam">Don't most humans live on level six?</q>
      <q class="brick">That's right. ... This is where the clinic is.</q>
      <p>Without another word, the android's eyes returned to the book.</p>
      <q class="brick">What are you reading?</q>
      <q class="sam">The complete poems of TS Elliot.</q>
      <q class="brick">Interesting choice. How do you like it?</q>
      <q class="sam">What do you mean?</q>
      <q class="brick">He wasn't completely sure what he meant. Androids allegedly didn't experience emotions, so he wasn't sure what one would get out of poetry. They certainly didn't have emotional outbursts or fits of laughing and crying. But they obviously had preferences. When he repaired one, they seemed to him subtly irritated with the malfunction of their body, and satisfied with the repair. He had the impression that sometimes, they could even be sentimental -- preferring to keep a broken part which had already been replaced, for example. Weren't those feelings? But psychology wasn't his expertise. </q>
      <q class="brick">Did anything stand out to you? Or make you think about something in a new way.</q>
      <q class="sam">Yes. There is one I wanted to understand.</q>
      <p>She flipped through the book.</p>
      <q class="sam">What type of person is this? On page 112.</q>
      <q class="brick">Read it to me.</q>

          We are the hollow men.

          Headpiece filled with straw. Alas,
          our dried voices, when
          We whisper together
          are quiet and meaningless
          as wind in dry grass,
          or rats' feet over broken glass
          in our dry cellar.
          Shape without form, shade without colour,
          Paralysed force, gesture without motion;</span></q>
      <q class="brick">I'm not really a poetry expert. But what was your question again?</q>
      <q class="sam">What kind of person is this? Hollow men. Stuffed men. Leaning together. Headpiece filled with straw. Crossed staves in a field. Behaving as the wind behaves. Quiet and meaningless voices.</q>
      <q class="brick">Ah. Right. It's about scarecrows. </q>
      <q class="sam">I see.</q>
      <q class="brick">Do you know what a scarecrow is? </q>
      <q class="sam">One moment. an object made to resemble a human figure, set up to scare birds away from a field of crops. So, it is a type of android?</q>
      <p>Brick chuckled.</p>
      <q class="brick">A very old type. Listen, I'm going to bed. Let me know if you have any trouble with the charger.</q>
      <q class="sam">Did you find anything of interest?</q>
      <q class="brick">I did. I'll explain in the morning. We're going antique shopping.</q>
      <p>With that he retreated into doctor's office.</p>
